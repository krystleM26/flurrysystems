# ❄️ Flurry Systems  
**Designing adaptive productivity ecosystems for individuals who value flow, not hustle.**

Flurry Systems is a modular platform that connects intelligent tools, systems, and templates into a single adaptive ecosystem.  
It’s built for developers, creators, and independent professionals who want to balance focus, wellness, and efficiency through smart automation and thoughtful design.

## 🧠 Core Components

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Flurry Architect** | The intelligence layer that personalizes workflows, analyzes user patterns, and orchestrates connected systems. |
| **App Suite** | The execution layer containing modular apps — each designed to perform focused tasks while communicating through shared logic. |
| **Library** | The knowledge and data layer — templates, automations, and documentation powering the system’s adaptive features. |

## 🚀 Current Phase — Q4 2025 Roadmap

| Stage | Focus | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **1. Architecture Documentation** | ✅ Completed | Established the system foundation and created architecture diagram + documentation. |
| **2. Repository Setup** | ✅ Completed | Configured GitHub structure with `docs`, `src`, and initial README. |
| **3. Core AI Design** | 🧠 In Progress | Developing the **Flurry Architect** logic model (system intelligence + adaptive flow rules). |
| **4. App Suite Prototype** | ⚙️ Planned | Building first App Suite module: dashboard + user input layer for testing flows. |
| **5. Library Integration** | 📚 Planned | Creating the template and automation repository that connects to Architect. |
| **6. Deployment + Feedback** | ⏳ Upcoming | Deploying MVP architecture to live environment for internal testing and iteration. |

## 💡 Vision

Flurry Systems exists to merge **productivity**, **intentional design**, and **AI-driven balance** — creating systems that adapt to the individual rather than the other way around.

> *Systems for flow. Tools for balance.*
